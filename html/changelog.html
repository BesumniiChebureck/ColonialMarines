				<li class="rscadd">Added the Gardener Strain for the drone. Ability details down below. Thanks Triiodine for all of the sprites. It benefits from slightly (5%) increased health regen.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Ability 1: Plant Fruit. (Macro 3). Plant an instance of the currently selected fruit (up to 3 fruits total). Consumes 50 health and 100 plasma. These fruits take some time to mature, and can be consumed by Xenomorph to gain an effect depending on the fruit's type. (See below)</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Added Unstable Resin Fruit. This fruit heals 75 health over a longer # of ticks, and also gives an overshield for 30% of max health, up to 200. This shield begins to decay after 90 seconds, at a rate of 10 per second. Does not stack with itself. It takes 45s to mature.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Spore Resin Fruit. This fruit passively gives off Level 1 Recovery pheromones in a range of one tile, and when consumed, makes each slashes increase your cooldown reduction by 5%, up to 25%. This buff lasts for 60 seconds. This mean any future cooldown will be reduced by that percentage. It takes 15s to mature.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Ability 2: Change Fruit. (Macro 4) Cycle between Greater/Unstable/Spore.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Ability 3: Resin Surge. (Macro 2) Depending on the tile targeted, has a different effect. 10 seconds cooldown. 75 Plasma cost. See below:</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Resin surge on a fruit reduce the time to maturation by 5s.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Resin surge on a weeded tile creates a 100 health wall for 5s. This wall cannot be thickened.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Resin surge on a unweeded tile creates sticky resins (3x3) at a location for 20s. These are weaker than regular sticky resin.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Lesser Resin Fruit. This fruit heals 75 health instantly when consumed.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Healer Drone also gain Plant Fruit, but may only plant Lesser Resin Fruit.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Taking damage while shielded as a Xeno will do a different sound effect. Thanks Triiodine for the sounds effect</li>
				<li class="tweak">Losing your xeno shield to damages will do a shattering sound.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Altered Vanguard shielding logic a little. There should be no difference in actual gameplay, so ping me if you notice something amiss.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Altered Shielding logic in general.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Buffed Defender.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Slamming into a wall after being thrown or flung into one now gives a message and sound indicating the hit.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Steelcrest defenders are no longer almost as fast fortified as they are unfortified. They are now slightly slower than pre-buff, and have reduced armor. However, they can still headbutt with a 1-tile push range, and can slash marines to deal 10 damage.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">If you have medical skills, you can click a vial with an unloaded hypospray, or click-drag a vial to an unloaded hypo, to perform a 'tactical reload'. This will transfer the old vial into your other hand, or drop the old vial on the ground if your hands are full.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The hypo can still be filled without removing the vial; it fills like any other beaker or flask, including pill dissolving, reagent tanks, and transfers from other vials. Of course, you can't transfer chemicals into a hypospray that doesn't have a vial.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The top-up port has a one-way valve; if you want to remove reagents from a hypospray, either syringe it or remove the vial.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">For the most part, this is all *additional* functionality - you can still use it in the same way you did before without any problems.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">I've tested this repeatedly and it all works as expected, but if you notice hypos or autoinjectors behaving strangely, @ me.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Introduces M2C Heavy Gunner Kit to Main Req Vendors at a limited scale (four per round, no more no less), this kit is built to act as a vanguard/flanking fire support using its C4 to breach through walls and barriers, and automatic machine gun to deal high damage in an immediate effect and area.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The M2C Heavy Gunner Kit comes with 2 sticks of C4, a tool pouch with an industrial welder, a crowbar, a wrench and an fire extinguisher to help with creating breaches in fences, cades or doors, a M10 Technician Helmet to shield the user's eyes, a pamphlet for engineering training and a M2C Heavy Machinegun System along with 500 rounds of ammunition in 125-round ammo boxes with a holster to stow this ammo. This kit is heavily designed for short and decisive attacks, and creating new flanks for marines to take advantage of to pressure Xenos.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Introduces M2C Heavy Machinegun, an upgraded and revised version of the M56D; it comes with full automatic fire capability and higher damage and rate of fire but less AP than the M56D, along with a more flexible and reactive tripod. However, it also has a debilitating overheating mechanic which limits sustained suppressing fire, or long-term engagements with its limited ammunition supply. Furthermore, it cannot be built near cades (adjacent tiles) in a 3x3 bubble, encouraging aggressive placement and positioning.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds special sound effects for the M2C HMG, including a shooting, overheat-cooling, rotating, reloading, ammo ejecting, and disassembling effect.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Equipping the Ghillie suit (and possessing sniper skills) enables the two abilities down below.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Ability 1: Prepare Position. After 4 seconds uninterrupted by anything, enter a cloak-like state. Your collision is removed (you still can get shot by non-friendly projectiles), you become near-invisible, and you enable Aimed Shot. Moving breaks the cloak entirely, and shooting make you more visible for 5 seconds. The shooting visibility debuffs stack and only resets once you stop firing for 5 seconds.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Ability 2: Aimed Shot. Can only be used while in full stealth. Display a lock-on on the target and channels for 1.25 seconds, then automatically fire at the target if the bullet has a chance to connect (No turf/blocking structure in the way/ Line of sight is still there). The shot is homing, though somewhat dodgeable if you can get an obstacle in time. If the shot connects with the intended recipient, the projectile does a critical hit, described below.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a critical hit effect to Sniper Marksman Bullet. It deals 3x the normal amount of damage (70 -> 210).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a critical hit effect to Sniper Incendiary Bullet. It maxes out the fire stack if they weren't already (they typically are), and blinds for ~2 seconds on Big Xenomorph (including fire-proofed one), ~5 for anything else. (Blind is the eye-blurry effect you've seen on marines).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a critical hit effect to Sniper Flak Bullet. The backlash is removed, but the base damage in doubled (Roughly a wash in term of total damage). In exchange, Big xeno are slowed for 4 seconds, and anyone else is slowed for 7 seconds.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">When using the Synthesis Simulator in AMPLIFY, SUPPRESS or RELATE mode, you now get 3 options for the new recipe component. The chosen component will either replace one of the existing recipe components or be added as an additional component. If you choose to add a rare component in this way you get 1 credit refunded.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Tweaked the value of some of the neutral properties.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Synthesis Simulator will now display the expected new OD threshold of a chemical before running the simulation.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Added a new mode to the Synthesis Simulator, CREATE mode. This mode allows researchers to create a new chemical from scratch.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">When creating a new chemical, researchers get to choose the properties, OD, name, and the rarity of recipe components.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The cost of creating a new chemical is based on all of the following. The level of each property, the number of property slots used, the OD level and the rarity of each component. Basic, common, uncommon and rare components add a +7, +4, +1 and -5 modifier to the cost respectively. Negative properties and most neutral, depending on the value of the property, decrease the cost rather than increase it. A penalty cost is added for each property above level 5 (+1 at 6, +2 at 7, +4 at 8, +5 at 9, +7 at 10). The minimum cost of creating a chemical is 5 credits.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The properties ATX, ACR, NGN, HPX, TXC and CRS are available for creation mode at round start. Scan chemicals in the XRF analyzer to make more properties available. Anomalous properties can not be added via create mode.</li>
				<li class="wip">CREATE mode does not take into consideration whether the properties you enabled might conflict and cancel each other out. So don't try this, you'll just waste your credits.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed an old bug with how we check if a recipe already exists. This was why researchers more often that they were supposed to, ended up with recipes of 4 or more components and why the simulator seemed biased towards adding more rare components.</li>
