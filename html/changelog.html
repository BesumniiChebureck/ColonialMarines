				<li class="rscadd">Introduces M2C Heavy Gunner Kit to Main Req Vendors at a limited scale (four per round, no more no less), this kit is built to act as a vanguard/flanking fire support using its C4 to breach through walls and barriers, and automatic machine gun to deal high damage in an immediate effect and area.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The M2C Heavy Gunner Kit comes with 2 sticks of C4, a tool pouch with an industrial welder, a crowbar, a wrench and an fire extinguisher to help with creating breaches in fences, cades or doors, a M10 Technician Helmet to shield the user's eyes, a pamphlet for engineering training and a M2C Heavy Machinegun System along with 500 rounds of ammunition in 125-round ammo boxes with a holster to stow this ammo. This kit is heavily designed for short and decisive attacks, and creating new flanks for marines to take advantage of to pressure Xenos.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Introduces M2C Heavy Machinegun, an upgraded and revised version of the M56D; it comes with full automatic fire capability and higher damage and rate of fire but less AP than the M56D, along with a more flexible and reactive tripod. However, it also has a debilitating overheating mechanic which limits sustained suppressing fire, or long-term engagements with its limited ammunition supply. Furthermore, it cannot be built near cades (adjacent tiles) in a 3x3 bubble, encouraging aggressive placement and positioning.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds special sound effects for the M2C HMG, including a shooting, overheat-cooling, rotating, reloading, ammo ejecting, and disassembling effect.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds sprites for (dis)assembled and destroyed M2C HMG, ammo box sprites, and sprites for the belt and other tools. (Credit to Triiodine for the gun, ammo and belt sprites)</li>
				<li class="bugfix">M2C HMG should no longer "black screen" upon folding the gun.</li>
				<li class="spellcheck">Typos fixed in description, revision of overheat information.</li>

			<h3 class="author">alardun updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Equipping the Ghillie suit (and possessing sniper skills) enables the two abilities down below.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Ability 1: Prepare Position. After 4 seconds uninterrupted by anything, enter a cloak-like state. Your collision is removed (you still can get shot by non-friendly projectiles), you become near-invisible, and you enable Aimed Shot. Moving breaks the cloak entirely, and shooting make you more visible for 5 seconds. The shooting visibility debuffs stack and only resets once you stop firing for 5 seconds.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Ability 2: Aimed Shot. Can only be used while in full stealth. Display a lock-on on the target and channels for 1.25 seconds, then automatically fire at the target if the bullet has a chance to connect (No turf/blocking structure in the way/ Line of sight is still there). The shot is homing, though somewhat dodgeable if you can get an obstacle in time. If the shot connects with the intended recipient, the projectile does a critical hit, described below.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a critical hit effect to Sniper Marksman Bullet. It deals 3x the normal amount of damage (70 -> 210).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a critical hit effect to Sniper Incendiary Bullet. It maxes out the fire stack if they weren't already (they typically are), and blinds for ~2 seconds on Big Xenomorph (including fire-proofed one), ~5 for anything else. (Blind is the eye-blurry effect you've seen on marines).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a critical hit effect to Sniper Flak Bullet. The backlash is removed, but the base damage in doubled (Roughly a wash in term of total damage). In exchange, Big xeno are slowed for 4 seconds, and anyone else is slowed for 7 seconds.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Pounces will still stun knocked down/collision-less marine if they land on their specific tile.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Specialist Kits (Defcon 2) gives the specific skill for the chosen specialist, rather than all specialists.</li>
				<li class="tweak">You can now toggle middle/shift clicking for abilities mid-round in your preferences.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">When using the Synthesis Simulator in AMPLIFY, SUPPRESS or RELATE mode, you now get 3 options for the new recipe component. The chosen component will either replace one of the existing recipe components or be added as an additional component. If you choose to add a rare component in this way you get 1 credit refunded.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Tweaked the value of some of the neutral properties.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Synthesis Simulator will now display the expected new OD threshold of a chemical before running the simulation.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Added a new mode to the Synthesis Simulator, CREATE mode. This mode allows researchers to create a new chemical from scratch.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">When creating a new chemical, researchers get to choose the properties, OD, name, and the rarity of recipe components.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The cost of creating a new chemical is based on all of the following. The level of each property, the number of property slots used, the OD level and the rarity of each component. Basic, common, uncommon and rare components add a +7, +4, +1 and -5 modifier to the cost respectively. Negative properties and most neutral, depending on the value of the property, decrease the cost rather than increase it. A penalty cost is added for each property above level 5 (+1 at 6, +2 at 7, +4 at 8, +5 at 9, +7 at 10). The minimum cost of creating a chemical is 5 credits.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The properties ATX, ACR, NGN, HPX, TXC and CRS are available for creation mode at round start. Scan chemicals in the XRF analyzer to make more properties available. Anomalous properties can not be added via create mode.</li>
				<li class="wip">CREATE mode does not take into consideration whether the properties you enabled might conflict and cancel each other out. So don't try this, you'll just waste your credits.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed an old bug with how we check if a recipe already exists. This was why researchers more often that they were supposed to, ended up with recipes of 4 or more components and why the simulator seemed biased towards adding more rare components.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Fixed Shaman Carrier not giving shields to other xenos.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Completely reworked Boxer Warrior skillset.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Boxer Warrior passive - KO Counter. Every hit against same opponent builds up KO counter. Slashes and disarms give 0.5 counter, while Punch and Jab give 1 counter. Changing target or not attacking target for 5 seconds will reset the counter. This includes abilities and usual attacks.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Second Boxer Warrior passive - Clarity. Boxer warrior can shrug off limited number of adverse effects (like daze and knockdown) before those effects can actually do something to it. Boxer Warrior starts with 6 stacks of clarity and regenerates one point each minute. Uppercut regenerates Clarity based on how much KO points they have.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Jab - 4 seconds cooldown. Range 3 ability that Boxer can use to reduce distance. On hit it does not deal damage, but slows and dazes target for 2 seconds (assuming 0 Endurance). It also resets Punch cooldown.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Punch - 4 seconds cooldown. Range 2 ability. On hit it deals same amount of damage as usual warrior punch, but does not break bones. This ability also pushes target 1-2 tiles away from you, and resets Jab cooldown.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Uppercut - 10 seconds cooldown. If you are near your target you will automatically hit them. On contact it will put your Jab and Punch on cooldown, reset your KO counter and heal you for 5% of max hp times the KO counter. It will also do following effects if the KO counter is high enough (all of them is KO counter is bigger or equal to 9)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If you have at least 1 KO point during Uppercut it will deal 15 damage per KO point</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If you have at least 3 KO points during Uppercut it will knock back target. This knockback scales with KO points and will deal damage if target hits wall.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If you have at least 6 KO points during Uppercut it will knock down the target for 3 (or more) seconds (assuming no Endurance). This scales with KO points.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If you have at least 9 KO points during Uppercut, target will be slept for 10 seconds and will be completely out cold.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Boxer max Clarity nerfed 6 -> 3.</li>

				<li class="experiment">Marine defences were slightly altered. I expect to see more barricades to be built and more to be destroyed by the Xenomorphs. Timers were increased to avoid cheesy dropping-op-stuff on top of T3s. If these changes lead to tedious megaFOBs, Xenomorphs may be given more tools to destroy them. Plasteel cades, for now, remain unchanged - I do not want to tweak too many things at once.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Its health was lowered from 200 to 140. (They cost 2 metal sheets + 2 rods, a barricade built from 5 sheets have 300 health.)</li>
				<li class="experiment">Special marine structures were tweaked in the following ways:</li>
				<li class="tweak">Their deployment time was raised to 3 seconds (from 2 and 1 seconds) except for the flag (which remained 1 second).</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Removed the RNG chance of instantly breaking sentries/tesla/etc. They now always break below 15% health.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Pyro now has a "Fire Shield" that makes them immune to getting burn damage and igniting from fire. Other sources, such as WP smoke, incen bullets, etc will still be able to ignite the pyro spec while the shield is active. The shield lasts 6 seconds with a 15 seconds cooldown.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Specialist abilities can be macro'd. For now, there are only the Specialist-Activation-One and Specialist-Activation-Two verbs. Specialist-Activation-One is for scout cloak and toggling broiler-T fuel type. Specialist-Activation-Two is for activating pyro fire shield. You can still macro the specific verbs for those tools, but these specialist ability macros are there so you do not need to keep adding them when a new macroable ability is added.</li>
				<li class="tweak">RNG mechanics related to fire damage and ignition of mobs should be removed. No more flamewalking (unless you're immune). Fire deals the same damage now (no more RNG damage or length of being set on fire). Resisting from fire puts out fires at a consistent amount. Values are subject to change.</li>
				<li class="tweak">M240T can be manually reloaded and unloaded as long as you are not wearing the Broiler-T back harness.

				<li class="maptweak">WO map has been tweaked a bit - there is a second bluespace beaker in chemistry, CO's quarters feature their tablet and the M46C gun, there are a handful of cryopods in the sleeping bunks, there are some operating tables in Triage, as well as some synth recharge stations.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Simplified Tcomms logic - it won't have to bounce through tcomm structures to get to your ears, hopefully meaning we'll have less chat overhead. This also means Tcomms won't be tied to Almayer (important for WO) - if you have a relay tower on the surface you can communicate there, even if Almayer is down.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Deleted unused communication logic from the various Tcomm machines.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Fixed Predalien sprites not working.</li>
				<li class="tweak">All basic suits can now fit some basic equipment into their HUD slot - a flashlight, crowbar, radio, health analyser, oxygen tank and a pen.

				<li class="tweak">Evilution time bonus is now incremented more granularly by about 0.1 every 3 minutes.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Spawn Pools spawn hive-appropriate larva.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Re-added a short timer for taking over an SSD larva to avoid some race conditions and people getting kicked out of larva they just occupied.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Added a new access class for civilians - civilian command.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">CORSAT access has been tweaked a bit - it won't require Corporate access, but use civilian command access.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Updated various survivor access to use some newly added access classes.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">CORSAT now has some Powerloader pamphlets around the Powerloader bays for those ungas that want to go Ripley on Queen's thorax.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Synth defibbing timer has been extended to give ghosts more time to get back into their body.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Defib healing amount has been made flat to that of a doctor skill.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Give Synth skill speed boost to some minor timers around stripping and putting items back onto people, tcomms assembly and repair, removing splints.</li>

				<li class="experiment">Reworked the chemical property system backend. All chemicals are now processed using properties, not just research chems. On the frontend chemicals should be basically unaffected by this, but some chemicals and some properties have still received minor tweaks as a result of the rework for the purpose of standardization.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the properties hemositic, thermostabilizing, focusing, cardiostabilizing, aiding, oxygenating, anticarcinogenic and ciphering.

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Overhauled internal logic of how power is handled.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a garbage collector to the game. It's basically a background process that will periodically delete junk items from the game to hopefully lower late game lag. The items removed shouldn't affect the gameplay - burnt out flares, empty boxes, spent casings, literal garbage, etc. It won't remove items from your inventory in case you want to hold onto something specifically, and it won't instantly delete newly created garbage.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added boxes of MREs and flares, so that Requisitions won't have to send them down in backpacks. Sprites by Triiodine.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changed Requisitions crates to use those boxes instead of the loose items.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changed Large Supply Crates to do the same (you can find one in Requisitions!).</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Removed weapon-specific skills (pistols, shotguns, SMGs, etc.) - they were too redundant.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Removed the Survival skill - it was only used to gate one recipe - molotov cocktail. Now everyone can make those! Just use paper on a bottle of something flammable.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Squished a lot of skill levels down to just a handful. They most often fall under "untrained / basic training (mini-kits) / trained (combat engis, combat medics, OTs, doctors, etc.)". Cut down on snowflake levels for singular roles, like Researchers being worse at surgery, or CEs being better at powerloader.</li>
				<li class="tweak">POs' Powerloader skill has been buffed. The only people with a mid-range powerloader skill are planned to be PFCs after reading a special pamphlet (not in a kit form, but found on colonies around powerloaders).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Some timers have been rebalanced based on the skill changes (like surgery).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Dual-wielding SMGs now has a higher scatter than before (due to removing snowflake SMG skill check).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Shipside Synths will have a new role to play in this new skill system. They will be more efficient at tasks with timers than even the specialised roles. This will mean they can prop up an entire department by themselves, so it will be up to the Command to apply them to the right place. Survivor Synthetics are not as well trained - they are only as good as a single trained individual, but still have the variety of skills to apply themselves anywhere.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Company has recently launched a colony diversity initiative! Not only will the Weston-Yamada colonies not be staffed by clones, they will have actual names and distinct features!</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changed the corpse spawner system to use Select Equipment system for loading gear, generating names, appearances, etc. This means the generated colonists will appear more varied.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">The new USCM protocols have established that walking is now prohibited. All personel must either run or stand still, no inbetween! This extends to every person and creature in the area of operation, civilian or extraterrestrial. (Removed walk intent, it wasn't used anyway, now you will always be running and now have to worry about fat fingering walking intent and dying because of it).</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Made WO compile again.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Motion detectors should properly disable themselves when a mob dies, gets hugged, gets buckled into a nest, etc.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Retrieve corpses objectives should display how many points they earn you, not only their completion percentage.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Removed some unused infrared sight from xenos (we don't use it anyway, it's a whole other BYOND feature).</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed some null error around holsters.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Dead people's headsets disable themselves automatically. This is for performance reasons. The radios don't disable themselves when you get hugged or nested, so you can preserve that gameplay. To re-enable the headset, just open its menu, it will turn itself on automatically. Hopefully this will improve late-game performance, not having to send messages to 100+ corpses...</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Added a command lockout to the bomb. If engaged by the command staff (anyone with Bridge access), it makes it so only command staff can toggle safety and toggle the timer. This is to limit potential griefing with the bomb timer.</li>
